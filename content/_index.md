# WeCoins

Code and APIs to make crypto currency easier.

## Ripple API

The [rippled server](https://github.com/ripple/rippled) comes with a variety of APIs, however it does not come with a REST-like HTTP API.

The [github.com/ripple/ripple-rest](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-rest) project is frozen with a recommendation to migrate to a JavaScript / TypeScript library [github.com/ripple/ripple-lib](https://github.com/ripple/ripple-lib) (aka RippleAPI).

WeCoins provides a HTTP-RPC API that supports all rippled functions.

### Hosted REST-like HTTP API Proxy
